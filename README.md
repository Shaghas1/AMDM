The zip folder contains:

3. Python Notebook which contains our experimentation on trying to minimise the objective function and obtaining balance :
4. Textfiles containing results - clusters for each node: File names with Kmeans4_$graphname$.txt shows the outputs for our modified Kmeans 
and BasicKmeans_$graphname$.txt shows the output for our basic Kmeans.
5. Graph Dataset which is used as the input : $graphname$.txt

To run the codes, please make sure that the graph datasets are in the same location as the codes are in.
