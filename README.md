# AMDM
The zip folder contains:
1. Final project report : AMDM_Project.pdf
2. Codes we used to obtain results in report : Project_main.py and kmeans4_main.py
3. Python Notebook which contains our experimentation on trying to minimise the objective function and obtaining balance : notebook_ideas
4. Textfiles containing results - clusters for each node: File names with Kmeans4_$graphname$.txt shows the outputs for our modified Kmeans 
and BasicKmeans_$graphname$.txt shows the output for our basic Kmeans.
5. Graph Dataset which is used as the input : $graphname$.txt

Notes on running the codes:
1. Download the zip and ensure that all the graph datasets(inputs) are in the same folder as the codes are in
2. Enter the name of the graph file you want to see the result of in the form $graph$.txt
3. Output would be the textfiles containing clusters and the value of the objective function

Python Notebook:
THe current exploration is done for graph ca-GrQc.txt. In order to see the outputs of other graphs, please change f_name in loading graph section.
